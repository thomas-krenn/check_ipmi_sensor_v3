 Requirements:
 -------------
   o Nagios or Icinga
   o FreeIPMI version 0.5.1 or newer
   o Perl
   o Perl IPC::Run


 Installation hints:
 -------------------
   On Debian/Ubuntu use 'apt-get install libipc-run-perl' to install IPC::Run.
   If you are running the plugin locally and not via network, the user 'nagios'
   needs root privileges for calling:
    o ipmimonitoring/ipmi-sensors/ipmi-sel/[ipmi-fru]
   You can achieve that by adding a sudoers config (e.g. for ipmi-sensors)
    o nagios ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ipmi-sensors, /usr/sbin/ipmi-sel
   Please check with '-vvv' which commands are run by the plugin!

 Notes on ipmi-sel:
 ------------------
   If you want to clear the ipmi system event log, pleas use:
    o /usr/sbin/ipmi-sel -h $IP -u ADMIN -p $PW -l ADMIN --clear
